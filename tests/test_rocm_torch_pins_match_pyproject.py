"""The ROCm reinstall must pin the same Torch stack the project resolves to.

An AMD source install does not come from ``uv.lock`` after setup swaps the CUDA
wheels for ROCm ones, so the pins used by ``scripts/setup.py`` must match the
project constraints.

A pin in two files stays correct only while someone remembers both.
``bootstrap.rs`` says "Keep in sync with [tool.uv.constraint-dependencies]",
and a comment cannot enforce itself — CLAUDE.md's convention is that a rule a
reviewer would have to remember belongs in a test. This is that test.

Failure here means an AMD user would get a different Torch stack from every
other platform, with no error at install time: the mismatch only shows up later
as ``operator torchvision::nms does not exist`` or a silent CPU fallback.
