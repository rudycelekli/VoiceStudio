"""Contributor License Agreement check for pull requests.

Runs from .github/workflows/cla.yml on the base branch's copy of this file, so
pull-request code never executes with the write token. Standard library only.

A pull request passes when the person who opened it and every commit author and
co-author has signed .github/CLA-<version>.md, or is a maintainer or GitHub App
bot recognised by account ID. People are matched by GitHub account ID, never by
git name, so changing `user.name` cannot impersonate a signer. Authors whose
commit email is not linked to a GitHub account cannot be verified and fail the
check with instructions.

Each run rescans every comment on the pull request (or signing issue) and
records any valid signature not yet stored, so the next run picks up anything a
run cancelled while queued missed. Edited comments never count; the check
replies once to a comment that looks like a signature but cannot be recorded,
saying why. The result is a
commit status named "CLA" on the head commit, which branch protection can
require. A maintainer can apply the `cla-override` label after reviewing a pull
request by hand, for example one that folds in commits from agent identities.
