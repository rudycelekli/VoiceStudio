## Release cadence

VoiceStudio ships **continuous-to-main** — no release candidates, no soak windows.
Every merged PR is immediately part of rolling source (`main`) and Docker
`:latest`. Electron artifact rehearsals validate desktop packages without publishing.
Version bumps require owner approval; validated releases are tagged from `main`
and published explicitly under [the release checklist](../docs/RELEASING.md).
Users who want stability install an Electron release or pin Docker `:stable`.
