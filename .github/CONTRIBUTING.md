## Adding a TTS or ASR engine

New engines are hired for a **named job**, not added to a list — the bar, the current job map,
and the out-of-tree path are in [docs/engine-acceptance.md](../docs/engine-acceptance.md).
Read it before opening a proposal; the licence check in particular ends most of them.

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- `curl` (used by the Bun / uv / rustup install one-liners on macOS and Linux)
- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) (frontend package manager)
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (Python environment manager)
- [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) (audio/video processing)
- [Rust / Cargo](https://rustup.rs/) (`native/desktop-bridge` and its imported Rust modules)
- Python 3.11+ (`requires-python` in `pyproject.toml`; managed automatically by `uv`)

Linux desktop development needs the native helper libraries. On Debian or
Ubuntu, install the same packages used by CI:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y \
  libasound2-dev libxdo-dev libxtst-dev libx11-dev libxkbcommon-dev \
  libwayland-dev libssl-dev pkg-config build-essential curl
```

See the [Linux source-build guide](../docs/install/linux.md#building-from-source)
for Fedora and Arch packages.

### Clone & Run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/debpalash/VoiceStudio.git
cd VoiceStudio
bun install
bun run setup:api  # prepare Python dependencies before starting Electron
bun run dev
```

This launches Electron with hot reload. Run source dependency setup explicitly before launching; the supervisor manages backend
startup; do not launch a second backend. See [Electron setup](../electron/README.md).
CPU-only Linux/Windows hosts automatically select CPU wheels; see
[CPU setup and overrides](../electron/README.md#running-without-a-gpu).
When regenerating `uv.lock` for compute variants, preserve unrelated package
versions: NumPy remains 2.0.2 on Python 3.12 Linux/Windows and 2.2.6 elsewhere.
Validate both frozen CPU/CUDA exports with `tests/test_cpu_install.py`; a NumPy
upgrade needs its own compatibility review.

```bash
bun run build       # build Electron
bun run start       # launch the built Electron app
bun run dist        # package locally without publishing
bun run smoke-test  # packaged startup, first-run consent, and native bridge
bun run smoke-test -- --install  # also install and start the managed backend
bun run dev:web     # maintained Electron renderer in a browser + backend
```

`bun run dev:web` starts both services:

| Service | URL | What it does |
|---------|-----|---|
| **Backend** | `localhost:3900` | FastAPI server — TTS, ASR, diarization, dubbing pipeline |
| **Frontend** | `localhost:3901` | Electron renderer served by Vite in a browser |

The backend runs through `scripts/dev-backend.mjs` (the `dev:api` script): the
uvicorn command is unchanged, but if the backend **dies** (OOM kill, hard
crash), the wrapper prints a boxed exit banner with the exit code/signal and
the last 20 lines of `omnivoice.log` before the dev stack shuts down — so the
cause doesn't scroll away with the terminal. The same death is also reported
as a crash notice in the UI the next time the backend starts (see
[docs/install/troubleshooting.md §14c](../docs/install/troubleshooting.md)).

### Retired desktop (Tauri)

Tauri is sunset after v0.5.3 and receives no further development or backports.
Use Electron for desktop contributions and reproduce desktop bugs there.
Existing users should follow the [migration guide](../docs/electron-migration.md).
The Tauri shell and its legacy UI entry points have been removed. Shared
modules and native helpers used by Electron remain maintained.

## How to Contribute

### Bug Reports

Open an [issue](https://github.com/debpalash/VoiceStudio/issues/new) with:

1. **What happened** vs **what you expected**
2. **Steps to reproduce**
3. **OS, GPU, and Python version** (find in Settings → Logs)
4. **Error logs** (Settings → Logs → copy relevant lines)

### Pull Requests

1. **Fork** the repo and create a branch from `main`
2. **Keep PRs focused** — one feature or fix per PR
3. **Run tests** before pushing:
   ```bash
   # Backend tests (the same two runs as CI)
   uv run pytest tests/ -q
   uv run pytest backend/tests/ -q

   # Frontend build check
   bun run check:electron
   ```
4. **Write a clear PR title** — it becomes the squash-merge commit message
5. **Don't include** local machine stats, file paths, or private system info in PR descriptions

### Adding a New TTS Engine

VoiceStudio's TTS backend is a plugin registry. Adding a new engine takes ~50 lines:

1. Open `backend/services/tts_backend.py`
2. Create a class extending `TTSBackend`:

```python
class MyEngineBackend(TTSBackend):
    id = "my-engine"
    display_name = "My Engine (description)"

    @classmethod
    def is_available(cls) -> tuple[bool, str]:
        try:
            import my_engine  # noqa: F401
            return True, "ready"
        except ImportError:
            return False, "my_engine not installed. pip install my-engine"

    @property
    def sample_rate(self) -> int:
        return 24000

    @property
    def supported_languages(self) -> list[str]:
        return ["en", "zh"]

    def generate(self, text: str, **kw) -> torch.Tensor:
        # ... call your engine, return [1, num_samples] tensor
```

3. Register it at the bottom of the file: in-file classes go in `_REGISTRY`;
   an engine that lives in its own `backend/engines/<name>` module goes in
   `_LAZY_REGISTRY` as `"id": ("engines.<name>", "ClassName")`
4. Add the same id under `tts_engines` in `docs/features.yaml` with its README
   string (`readme:`) or a doc page (`doc:`) — the daily docs-drift job
   (`python scripts/check-docs-drift.py`) flags registry ids missing from it
5. It then appears in Settings → TTS Engine

## Code Style

### Python (Backend)

- **Formatter**: We don't enforce one globally — match the style of the file you're editing
- **Logging**: Use `logger.warning()` / `logger.error()`, never bare `print()`
- **Exceptions**: Avoid bare `except: pass` — catch specific exceptions
- **Type hints**: Use them for public API functions and class methods

### JavaScript/React (Frontend)

- **Components**: Functional components with hooks
- **State**: Zustand slices in `electron/src/shared/store/`
- **Brand assets**: Reuse the canonical mark, palette, naming, and compatibility rules in [`docs/branding.md`](../docs/branding.md); do not redraw or rename runtime identifiers ad hoc
- **CSS**: Tailwind v4 utilities + the shadcn/ui primitives in `electron/src/renderer/src/components/ui/`, themed by the tokens in `electron/src/renderer/src/styles/` (`globals.css`, `t3-theme.css`). Prefer utilities; add or extend a co-located `.css` file only for what utilities cannot express (`@keyframes`, pseudo-elements, styling hooks on library-generated DOM).
- **Naming**: `PascalCase` for components, `camelCase` for hooks and utils

### Rust (shared native helpers)

- **Format**: `cargo fmt` before committing
- **Scope**: `native/desktop-bridge` and modules it imports; do not revive the archived Tauri shell.

## Frontend file structure & size limits

Frontend code stays modular so an edit loads one small file, not a 1900-line
one. The rules:

- **Size caps:** **soft 300 lines**, **hard 500 lines** per component file
  (`.jsx`/`.tsx`). Anything over 500 lines must be split.
- **Pages are thin orchestrators.** A file in `electron/src/shared/pages/` is just
  layout + routing + state wiring that composes feature components — no inline
  sub-component over ~50 lines.
- **One component per file.** Co-locate `Foo.jsx` + `Foo.test.jsx` together in a
  per-page feature folder under `electron/src/shared/components/` (e.g.
  `components/settings/`, `components/dub/`). Style with utilities + shadcn
  first (see the CSS rule above).
- **Shared bits go in a `primitives/` folder** inside the feature folder
  (`components/settings/primitives/` is the existing example).
- **Enforced in review, not by lint:** `bun run lint` (oxlint) has no
  `max-lines` rule, so reviewers apply the caps.

## Commit Messages

Write clear, concise messages. The PR title becomes the squash-merge commit.

```
good: fix: prevent CUDA OOM during concurrent transcription + TTS
good: feat: add CosyVoice 3 TTS backend adapter
good: docs: add platform compatibility matrix to README

bad:  fixed stuff
bad:  update
bad:  WIP
```

Commit with a real identity (your GitHub noreply address works). The
`commit-identity` PR check (`scripts/check_commit_identities.py`) fails when a
PR commit's author, committer, or `Co-authored-by:`/`Signed-off-by:` email is
a placeholder (`test@local`, `you@example.com`, `mergetest`, hostname-style
`*.local`), an AI agent, or on the hashed block list, or when a commit message
or the PR description credits an AI agent. Fix an identity on the listed
commits only: `git rebase -i origin/main`, mark each listed commit `edit`, and
at each stop run `git commit --amend --no-edit --reset-author` and
`git rebase --continue` (a blanket `--exec` would also take over other
people's commits); fix agent credit by rewording the commit messages (`git rebase -i`, then
`reword`) and editing the PR description.

---

## Testing

Native-call timeout tests should synchronize with confirmed worker entry before
starting their short test deadline, and join released workers during cleanup.
Cover delayed startup separately so runner scheduling does not masquerade as a
native-call timeout or leak work into later tests.

```bash
# Run the backend suites CI runs (kept separate: backend/tests is isolated)
uv run pytest tests/ -q
uv run pytest backend/tests/ -q

# Run a specific test file
uv run pytest tests/test_app_version.py -q

# Electron desktop validation, from the repository root
bun run check:electron

# Shared native helper, when changed
cargo check --manifest-path native/desktop-bridge/Cargo.toml
```

## What code review looks like

Every PR is reviewed by two AI reviewers before a human looks at it:

- **CodeRabbit** posts a short collapsed summary (no diagrams), inline
  findings, and warning-mode pre-merge checks against the project's hard
  rules (configured in `.coderabbit.yaml`).
- **Greptile** reviews with the same project rubrics and learns from 👍/👎
  reactions on its comments — react to train it.

Both are advisory, not gating: CI and the maintainer's approval decide. Don't
be surprised by detailed bot comments minutes after you open a PR — address
what's right, push back (in a reply) on what's wrong.

**Commit & PR conventions:** conventional-commit style with a scope
(`fix(dub): …`, `feat(setup): …`) and link the issue (`Closes #N` / `Refs #N`)
in the title or body.

### Contributing with AI agents

Plenty of contributions here are built with Claude Code, Cursor, and similar
agents — welcome, with the same quality bar as hand-written PRs (real bug,
correct fix, regression test; see the quality gates below).

You submit agent-assisted work as your own, under your own git identity. Don't
credit agents in commits or the PR description: no `Co-authored-by:` trailer
for an AI agent, no "Generated with …" line, no agent session or share links
(claude.ai, chatgpt.com) and no `Claude-Session:` trailer. The
`commit-identity` check fails PRs that carry them. Co-authors who are people
are welcome, including people with first names that also name an agent, such
as Claude, Jules, or Devin. Known agent email addresses remain blocked. The
identity workflow runs the base branch's policy and publishes `Commit identity
policy`; changing the checker or workflow in your PR does not bypass it.

Keep one open PR per head commit. CLA checks reject duplicate heads because
GitHub commit statuses are shared by SHA, even when PR descriptions or authors
differ. Close duplicates and comment `recheck` on the survivor, then rerun its
trusted identity workflow.

One practical tip: this codebase is large, and re-explaining it to your agent
every session burns context and tokens fast. A persistent memory layer fixes
that — the agent recalls the architecture, conventions, and your past findings
instead of re-reading the tree each time. [**memxt**](https://github.com/debpalash/memxt)
(100% local, MCP-based, built by this project's maintainer) exists for exactly
this; any MCP memory server works. Pair it with the repo's agent skill —
`npx skills add debpalash/VoiceStudio` — so your agent knows the project's
hard rules from the first prompt.

## Quality gates your PR must pass

- **Cross-platform parity (hard rule):** anything that ships in default mode
  must behave identically on macOS, Windows, and Linux. Platform-specific
  *implementation* is fine; platform-divergent *default behavior* is a P0.
  Platform-only features go behind an explicit opt-in (Settings toggle, env
  var, or CLI flag).
- **i18n — all 21 locales (hard rule):** every user-facing string goes through
  `t('...')` and the key must exist in **all 21** files of the catalog the code
  uses: `electron/src/shared/i18n/locales/` (checked by
  `tests/test_locale_parity.py`) or `electron/src/renderer/src/i18n/locales/`
  (checked by `bun run --cwd electron locale:check`). Translate; don't copy
  English into non-English locales. CI fails on hardcoded CJK outside the allowlist in
  `tests/test_no_hardcoded_cjk.py` (extend `_ALLOWED_FILES` with a
  justification for legitimate functional CJK).
- **DB schema changes** go through an alembic migration with a tested upgrade
  path — existing `omnivoice_data/` must keep working with no manual steps.
- **Engine back-compat:** already-installed engines (model weights on disk)
  must not require reinstall or re-download.
- **Local-first:** no new outbound calls, and the app must work fully offline
  with every prompt declined. The only sanctioned ones are:
  - **First-run setup the user starts:** the pinned, SHA-256-verified
    ffmpeg/ffprobe download from GitHub (`zackees/ffmpeg_bins`) when no usable
    copy is found (`backend/services/media_tools.py`); the huggingface.co vs
    hf-mirror.com reachability probe that picks a download endpoint on
    restricted networks, skipped when the user set an endpoint
    (`backend/services/endpoint_race.py`); and Hugging Face model downloads
    (gated on install state or an explicit user action).
  - **Galleries the user opens or enables:** the community gallery manifest
    from jsDelivr plus its GitHub-hosted previews
    (`backend/api/routers/community.py`); the voice-preview gallery's signed
    downloads from `omnivoice-gallery` GitHub Releases, only after it is turned
    on in Settings (`backend/services/gallery.py`).
  - **Packaged-app update checks** against GitHub Releases; downloads wait for
    the user (`electron/src/main/updater.ts`).
  - **yt-dlp updates** from PyPI, only when the user clicks update
    (`backend/services/media_tools.py`).
  - Bug reports as prefilled GitHub Issue URLs opened in the user's browser.
  - PostHog analytics only after a yes at the first-run consent prompt
    (`backend/core/analytics.py`, allowlisted content-free metadata).
  - The GitHub star count (no credentials or referrer, refreshed every 20
    minutes while shown).
  - The Lemon Squeezy Pro licence check, only after the user enters a key
    (`electron/src/main/pro-license.ts`).

  Adding to this list needs owner approval. Never log or persist secrets or
  absolute home paths.
- **Security posture:** the backend serves loopback HTTP — treat every
  query/path/form parameter as hostile. User-chosen filesystem destinations
  are authorized in Electron main (native save dialog), never via HTTP params.
- **CI supply chain:** every remote action in `.github/workflows/` is pinned
  to a full 40-char commit SHA with a trailing `# vX.Y.Z` comment
  (`tests/test_actions_pinned.py`); Dependabot bumps the pins weekly.

## Contribution licensing

VoiceStudio is **AGPL-3.0-only**, and the maintainer also offers a
**commercial license** (see [LICENSE-NOTICE.md](../LICENSE-NOTICE.md)). Before
a pull request can merge, the person who opened it and every commit author and
co-author sign the [Contributor License Agreement](CLA-1.0.md) once. You keep
your copyright. The agreement lets Yupcha Softwares Private Limited, the
company that maintains VoiceStudio, ship your work in both the AGPL-3.0 app and
commercial builds. In return, the company commits that while your contribution
is in the public VoiceStudio repository, it stays available there under
AGPL-3.0 or another OSI-approved licence (CLA section 4). AI agents can't be co-authors (see
[Contributing with AI agents](#contributing-with-ai-agents)); the person
submitting the work signs for it.

The **CLA** check comments on your pull request when someone still needs to
sign. To sign, post this as a new comment, on its own line:

```text
I have read the VoiceStudio CLA 1.0 and I hereby sign it.
```

The signature covers your earlier and future contributions, and the check
turns green on its own. If a maintainer folds your pull request into another
one, you sign once there too. Contributed before and have no open pull request? Post
the same line on the [issue labelled `cla`](https://github.com/debpalash/VoiceStudio/issues?q=label%3Acla). If it lists a commit it cannot link to a GitHub
account, either add that commit email to your account (Settings → Emails), or
rewrite the commits with an email that is on it (`git commit --amend
--reset-author`, or an interactive rebase) and push again. Comment `recheck` to
run the check without pushing. Contributing as part of your job? Your employer
signs the [Corporate CLA](CCLA-1.0.md) first, and you still sign the CLA
yourself. Adding a `Signed-off-by:` line (DCO) is appreciated but does not
replace the CLA.
