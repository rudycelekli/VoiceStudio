"""Pre-migration SQLite safety net (data-safe updates).

Before ``alembic upgrade head`` applies *pending* migrations at startup —
which is exactly the first launch of a new app version that changed the
schema — the live database is snapshotted next to itself as
``omnivoice.db.backup-<version>-<n>`` so a failed or interrupted migration
can never cost user data (voices, projects, history, settings).

Design rules (owner intent: "never corrupt/erase user data on update"):

- Snapshots use the SQLite online-backup API (``sqlite3.Connection.backup``),
  not a file copy — the live DB runs in WAL mode, so a plain copy could miss
  everything still sitting in ``omnivoice.db-wal``.
- Only the most recent ``KEEP_BACKUPS`` snapshots are kept; older ones are
  pruned so backups can't grow without bound.
- DBs larger than ``MAX_BACKUP_DB_BYTES`` are skipped with a log line (a
  multi-hundred-MB copy on every schema upgrade is worse than the risk it
  hedges on those installs).
- Restore is NEVER automatic. On migration failure the caller
  (``core.db._run_alembic_upgrade``) stops startup and names the backup path
  so the user (or a support thread) decides — a silent auto-restore could
  itself discard data written after the snapshot.
